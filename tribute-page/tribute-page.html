        <h1>Nikola Tesla</h1>
        <p>
            A Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer,
            and futurist best known for his contributions to the design of the
            modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.

            <h2>Here's a time line of Tesla's life:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>1856</strong> - Born in Smiljan, Austrian Empire (modern-day
                    Croatia)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1870</strong> - Tesla moved to Karlovac to attend high
                    school at the Higher Real Gymnasium where the classes were held in
                    German, as it was usual throughout schools within the
                    Austro-Hungarian Military Frontier.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1873</strong> - Tesla returned to Smiljan. Shortly after he
                    arrived, he contracted cholera, was bedridden for nine months and
                    was near death multiple times.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1875</strong> - Tesla enrolled at the Imperial-Royal
                    Technical College in Graz on a Military Frontier scholarship. At
                    Graz, Tesla was fascinated by the detailed lectures on electricity
                    presented by Professor Jakob Pöschl.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1881</strong> - Tesla moved to Budapest, Hungary, to work
                    under Tivadar Puskás at a telegraph company, the Budapest Telephone
                    Exchange. During his employment, Tesla made many improvements to the
                    Central Station equipment and claimed to have perfected a telephone
                    repeater or amplifier, which was never patented nor publicly
                    described.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1882</strong> - Tivadar Puskás got Tesla another job in
                    Paris with the Continental Edison Company. Management took notice of
                    his advanced knowledge in engineering and physics and soon had him
                    designing and building improved versions of generating dynamos and
                    motors.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1884</strong> - Tesla emigrated to USA and began working
                    almost immediately at the Edison Machine Works on Manhattan's Lower
                    East Side, an overcrowded shop with a workforce of several hundred
                    machinists, laborers, managing staff, and 20 "field engineers"
                    struggling with the task of building the large electric utility in
                    that city. Tesla had been working at the Machine Works for a total
                    of six months when he quit.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1887</strong> - Tesla developed an induction motor that ran
                    on alternating current (AC), a power system format that was rapidly
                    expanding in Europe and the United States because of its advantages
                    in long-distance, high-voltage transmission.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1890</strong> - Tesla experimented with transmitting power
                    by inductive and capacitive coupling using high AC voltages
                    generated with his Tesla coil. He attempted to develop a wireless
                    lighting system based on near-field inductive and capacitive
                    coupling and conducted a series of public demonstrations where he
                    lit Geissler tubes and even incandescent light bulbs from across a
                    stage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1891</strong> - Aged 35, Tesla became a naturalized citizen
                    of the United States.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1895</strong> - In the early morning hours, the South Fifth
                    Avenue building that housed Tesla's lab caught fire. It started in
                    the basement of the building and was so intense Tesla's 4th-floor
                    lab burned and collapsed into the second floor. The fire not only
                    set back Tesla's ongoing projects, but it also destroyed a
                    collection of early notes and research material, models, and
                    demonstration pieces, including many that had been exhibited at the
                    1893 Worlds Colombian Exposition
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1898</strong> - Tesla demonstrated a boat that used a
                    coherer-based radio control—which he dubbed "telautomaton"—to the
                    public during an electrical exhibition at Madison Square Garden.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1906</strong> - On his 50th birthday, Tesla demonstrated a
                    200 horsepower (150 kilowatts) 16,000 rpm bladeless turbine.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1915</strong> - A Reuters news agency report from London had
                    the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics awarded to Thomas Edison and Nikola
                    Tesla; however, on 15 November, a Reuters story from Stockholm
                    stated the prize that year was being awarded to Sir William Henry
                    Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg "for their services in the analysis
                    of crystal structure by means of X-rays".
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1928</strong> - Tesla received his last patent, U.S. Patent
                    1,655,114, for a biplane design capable of vertical take-off and
                    landing (VTOL), which "gradually tilted through manipulation of the
                    elevator devices" in flight until it was flying like a conventional
                    plane. Although the aircraft has been described as impractical, it
                    has early resemblances to the V-22 Osprey used by the US military.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1931</strong> - A young journalist whom Tesla befriended,
                    Kenneth M. Swezey, organized a celebration for the inventor's 75th
                    birthday. Tesla received congratulatory letters from more than 70
                    pioneers in science and engineering, including Albert Einstein, and
                    he was also featured on the cover of Time magazine. The party went
                    so well that Tesla made it an annual event.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1937</strong> - At the age of 81, after midnight one night,
                    Tesla left the Hotel New Yorker to make his regular commute to the
                    cathedral and library to feed the pigeons. While crossing a street a
                    couple of blocks from the hotel, Tesla was unable to dodge a moving
                    taxicab and was thrown to the ground. His back was severely wrenched
                    and three of his ribs were broken in the accident.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1943</strong> - At the age of 86, Tesla died alone in Room
                    3327 of the Hotel New Yorker.
